# Files
- detection.py: This file consists of inference code for this project
- vietnamese-license-plate-detection-with-dert.ipynb: This file contains the training code of License Plate Detection with DeRT

# Introduce:
- In this project, I used the DeRT model to detect the license plate and then used paddle OCR to recognize the license plate. But you can train vehicle detection and then use paddle OCR.

# Data:
- You can download here: https://github.com/trungdinh22/License-Plate-Recognition

# Training:
- You can use vietnamese-license-plate-detection-with-dert.ipynb file to train the license plate detection or something. Note: I set up queries = 20 and n_classes = 2. You can customize it in your way.

# Inference:
 ```
  pipeline = LicensePlateInference(device = 'cpu') # initialize pipeline
  # If you want to infer with image URL or np array you can use the following function
  image = pipeline.inference('input.jpeg',output_url='output.jpeg')
  # or
  image = pipeline.inference(frame,output_url='output.jpeg')
  # If you want to infer with video you can use the following function
  pipeline.video_inference('input.mp4','output.mp4')
 ```
- Please take note of the image generated by the pipeline.inference includes bounding boxes and text
